# Darktrace

## Introduction

Darktrace is one of the pioneers in using AI for cybersecurity. Its Enterprise Immune System mimics the human immune system to detect, respond to, and contain potential cyber threats automatically.

Key features: 
- Anomaly detection and response using unsupervised machine learning.
- Autonomous detection of advanced threats in real-time.
- AI-driven autonomous response (Antigena) that takes immediate action.

### Why Darktrace?

- AI-based anomaly detection: Darktrace excels in detecting subtle and sophisticated threats, such as insider threats or advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are common in the financial sector.

- Self-learning AI: Its AI learns the normal behavior of every user and device in a financial network, enabling it to detect unusual activity in real-time. This helps banks protect against fraud, phishing attacks, and other forms of cybercrime.

- Regulatory compliance: Darktrace helps financial institutions meet compliance standards by identifying security
